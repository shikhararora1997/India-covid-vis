Tableau dashboard depicting Covid-19 trends in India
<h1>During my first term in the Master's program, I created an immersive Tableau dashboard that visualized the trends of the COVID-19 outbreak in India. This captivating dashboard was built using publicly available data sourced from Kaggle, providing users with a powerful tool for studying the impact of the pandemic on the country. Its user-friendly interface allows anyone to quickly grasp the severity of the situation and track the progression of the disease over time.</h1>
